## Features

## Testing

### Bugs
### Fixed bugs 
- Unflipping cards for non matches for more than one pair. 
- Game over message appearing as well as the congratulatory message appearing one after each other at the end of a game.
- Game over/completion game messages appearing at the end of memory game before matching all cards when 2 seconds left in timer. 
### Unfixed Bugs
- Responsiveness issue of memory game not working on larger screens.
- Card-back image for cards on memory game are not aligning centrally in each card-item container.
- 3rd card in a row can still be clicked when trying to match 2 cards that don't work, but it is sort of ok when the unflipping happens after a short length of time for unmatches as setTimeout has a short time.
- Matching pair and non-matching pair messages alerting users when they match or don't match a pair sometimes both show up above the game board.

## Testing

I have run all the html and css pages through the html and css validators and I can confirm there are no errors.
